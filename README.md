### 1. SumLoop
Print the sum of the current number and the previous number.
### 2. Even Characters
Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number.
### 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors
The famous game from our childhood, now recreated in Python. I'm proud of this one as this is my first serious project!
Made this to test a different form of validation with "try" and "except" and also figuring out how colors work here.
